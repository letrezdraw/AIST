# Core AI and ML Libraries
# llama-cpp-python with CUDA 12.1 support.
# This uses a pre-compiled wheel to avoid needing a C++ compiler installed on the system.
# The --extra-index-url points pip to a special repository with these wheels.
# If you have a different CUDA version (e.g., 11.8), change 'cu121' to 'cu118'.
# The URL is now passed via the start_aist.bat script.
