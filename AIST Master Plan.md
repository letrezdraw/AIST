# **AIST Master Plan: The Architectural Encyclopedia**

**1\. Transition to Asynchronous Message Bus**

* **1.1. Topic-Based Routing with Wildcards:** Implement a sophisticated topic hierarchy (e.g., request.cognition.inference, event.context.window\_changed). Services can subscribe to specific topics or use wildcards (event.context.\*) to listen to entire event categories, enabling flexible data flow.  
* **1.2. Guaranteed Delivery & Quality of Service (QoS):** Define QoS levels for messages. Critical commands (e.g., skill.execute\_request) will require acknowledgement (QoS 1), while high-frequency, non-critical data (e.g., event.context.mouse\_position) can be "fire-and-forget" (QoS 0).  
* **1.3. Backpressure Handling & Dead-Letter Queues:** If a consumer service is overwhelmed, the message bus must handle the backpressure without crashing. Unprocessable or failed messages will be automatically routed to a "dead-letter queue" for later inspection and debugging.  
* **1.4. Centralized Message Schema Registry:** All message formats will be defined using a schema language (like JSON Schema or Protobuf). A central registry service will validate all messages, ensuring services cannot send malformed data and cause downstream errors.  
* **1.5. End-to-End Payload Encryption:** For ultimate security, especially in preparation for future cross-device synchronization, the payload of every message on the bus will be encrypted. Only the intended recipient service will hold the key to decrypt it.

**2\. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**

* **2.1. Dynamic Service Discovery:** Services will not have hardcoded addresses. On startup, they will register themselves with a central DiscoveryService (like Consul or a custom implementation), allowing other services to look them up by name (e.g., "CognitiveEngineService").  
* **2.2. Load Balancing for Critical Services:** Implement the ability to run multiple instances of stateless services (like the CognitiveEngineService). The message bus or a dedicated load balancer will distribute requests among them, allowing AIST to handle heavier cognitive loads.  
* **2.3. Fault Tolerance & Automatic Restart Policies:** A master OrchestratorService will monitor the health of all other services. If a service crashes, the orchestrator will automatically attempt to restart it according to predefined policies (e.g., "restart up to 3 times, then notify user").  
* **2.4. Inter-Service Authentication & Authorization:** Implement a token-based system. Each service gets a short-lived token on startup, which it must present when making critical requests, ensuring that only authorized AIST services can command each other.  
* **2.5. Resource Isolation & Containerization:** For ultimate stability, each AIST service will be designed to run in its own process with clearly defined memory and CPU limits. In a future deployment, these could be containerized (e.g., using Docker) for perfect isolation.

**3\. Centralized Configuration Management**

* **3.1. Dynamic Configuration Updates:** The ConfigService will allow for hot-reloading of certain configuration values without restarting the entire AIST system. Services can subscribe to config.updated events to receive new settings on the fly.  
* **3.2. Hierarchical & Environment-Specific Configs:** Support multiple configuration files that override each other (e.g., base.yaml, development.yaml, user.yaml). This allows for a clean separation of default settings, development overrides, and user-specific preferences.  
* **3.3. Schema Validation for Configuration:** The config.yaml file itself will be validated against a master schema on startup to prevent errors from typos or incorrect data types.  
* **3.4. Secrets Management Integration:** The ConfigService will not store plain-text secrets. It will integrate with the CredentialVault (Point 6), fetching secrets at runtime and injecting them into the configuration provided to other services.  
* **3.5. Versioned Configurations:** The ConfigService will keep a history of configuration changes, allowing for easy rollback to a previously known-good state if a change causes issues.

**4\. Robust, Structured Logging Service**

* **4.1. Correlation ID Tracking:** Every initial request (e.g., a user speaking) generates a unique correlation\_id. This ID is passed along in the headers of every subsequent message on the bus related to that request, allowing for easy tracing of a single command's journey through all services.  
* **4.2. Dynamic Log Level Control:** The LoggingService will expose an interface to change the log level for specific services in real-time (e.g., set\_log\_level('CognitiveEngineService', 'DEBUG')) without a restart, enabling targeted debugging.  
* **4.3. Log-Based Event Triggering:** The LoggingService can be configured to watch for specific error patterns. If a certain error occurs more than X times in Y minutes, it can publish a system.alert event to the message bus, triggering a notification to the user.  
* **4.4. Structured Logging Format (JSON):** All logs will be emitted in a structured JSON format, not plain text. This makes them machine-readable and easy to parse, query, and visualize in potential future diagnostic tools.  
* **4.5. Log Shipping & Archiving:** Implement functionality to automatically archive old log files to a compressed format and, if configured, ship them to a central location for long-term analysis.

**5\. Global State Manager**

* **5.1. Finite State Machine (FSM) Implementation:** The manager will be built as a formal Finite State Machine, ensuring that state transitions are valid (e.g., cannot go from SLEEPING to SPEAKING without passing through LISTENING and THINKING).  
* **5.2. Contextual Sub-States:** Within a global state, services can have sub-states. For example, in the global CONVERSATIONAL state, the UserInterfaceService might be in a displaying\_transcription sub-state.  
* **5.3. State-Based Permissions:** The GlobalStateManager will act as a guard. A service requesting a high-resource action (like a full screen analysis) may be denied if the global state is currently EXECUTING\_CRITICAL\_TASK.  
* **5.4. State Transition Auditing:** Every change in the global state is logged with information about which service requested the change and why, providing a clear audit trail of the system's behavior.  
* **5.5. User-Override and Manual State Control:** Provide a "developer" skill that allows the user to manually force the system into a specific state for debugging purposes (e.g., "AIST, force state to IDLE").

**6\. Secure Credential Vault**

* **6.1. Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) for Service Access:** For extremely high-security operations, services might need to provide a TOTP generated by the vault to prove their identity, preventing replay attacks.  
* **6.2. In-Memory Credential Caching:** To avoid constant disk access, the vault will securely cache decrypted credentials in memory for a very short period, clearing them immediately after use.  
* **6.3. Credential Rotation API:** The vault will expose a secure API for rotating API keys and other credentials without manual intervention. AIST could have a skill to do this automatically for supported services.  
* **6.4. Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration:** For ultimate security, the master key for the vault itself could be stored in a hardware-based solution like a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip on the motherboard.  
* **6.5. Per-Skill Credential Scoping:** Credentials will be scoped to the specific skills that need them. The WebSearchSkill will only be able to request the "Google Search API Key," not the "Google Calendar API Key."

**7\. Heartbeat and Health Check System**

* **7.1. Deep Health Checks:** Beyond a simple alive heartbeat, services will expose a /health endpoint that runs a series of internal checks (e.g., "Can I connect to the database?", "Is the LLM loaded?"). The health report will be detailed.  
* **7.2. Circuit Breaker Pattern:** If a service repeatedly fails its deep health check, the OrchestratorService will trip a "circuit breaker," temporarily stopping all requests to that service to allow it to recover and prevent cascading failures.  
* **7.3. Latency and Performance Monitoring:** Heartbeats will include performance metrics (e.g., "average inference time," "messages processed per second"). This data can be used to detect performance degradation over time.  
* **7.4. Graceful Shutdown Protocol:** When AIST is shutting down, the OrchestratorService sends a shutdown.request message. Services will perform cleanup tasks (saving state, closing connections) and then send a shutdown.ack message before terminating.  
* **7.5. Predictive Failure Analysis:** The health monitor will log performance data over time. By analyzing trends (e.g., slowly increasing memory usage in one service), it can predict a potential future failure and proactively alert the user or restart the service during an idle period.

**8\. Episodic Memory \- The Journal**

* **8.1. Multi-Modal Utterances:** The schema will be expanded to include not just text, but also paths to related data, such as a recording of the user's audio (audio\_path) or a screenshot taken during the conversation (screenshot\_path).  
* **8.2. Emotional Annotation:** Each user utterance will be analyzed for sentiment and emotional content (e.g., sentiment: \-0.8, emotion: 'frustrated'). This data is crucial for building a more empathetic AI.  
* **8.3. Speaker Diarization:** In conversations with multiple audible speakers, the system will attempt to differentiate and tag who is speaking (speaker: 'user\_1', speaker: 'user\_2').  
* **8.4. Causal Linking:** Utterances will be linked causally. AIST's response will have a direct foreign key reference to the user's utterance that prompted it, creating a clear conversational chain of cause and effect.  
* **8.5. Automatic PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Redaction:** Before being stored long-term, transcripts will be processed by an agent that identifies and redacts or encrypts sensitive PII (like credit card numbers, passwords mentioned aloud), replacing them with placeholders.

**9\. Conversation Summarization Agent**

* **9.1. Abstractive vs. Extractive Summarization:** The agent will be able to perform both. Extractive (pulling key sentences) for quick summaries, and abstractive (generating new sentences) for more human-like, high-level summaries.  
* **9.2. Action-Item Extraction:** During summarization, the agent will specifically look for and extract action items, deadlines, and commitments (e.g., "User agreed to send the report by Friday"). These are stored as structured data.  
* **9.3. Hierarchical Summaries:** The agent will create summaries at different levels of granularity: a one-sentence summary, a one-paragraph summary, and a detailed summary with bullet points. This allows for flexible retrieval depending on the need.  
* **9.4. User-Guided Summarization:** The user can influence the process: "AIST, summarize our conversation, focusing on the budget decisions." This context is passed to the summarization agent.  
* **9.5. Cross-Conversation Topic Tracking:** The agent will tag summaries with topics. Over time, it can link summaries from different conversations that share the same topic, creating a longitudinal record of a project or idea.

**10\. Semantic Memory \- The Knowledge Graph**

* **10.1. Temporal Edges:** Relationships in the graph will have timestamps. (John, works\_at, Google) will have start\_date and end\_date properties. This allows AIST to understand that facts can change over time.  
* **10.2. Weighted & Valenced Relationships:** Edges will have weights to signify the strength or importance of a relationship, and a valence (positive/negative) to capture sentiment. (user, likes, coffee) could have a high positive weight.  
* **10.3. Multi-Lingual Entity Resolution:** The graph will resolve entities across languages. The node for "Eiffel Tower" will be linked to its French name "Tour Eiffel," allowing for cross-lingual queries.  
* **10.4. Inference Engine:** The graph will support rule-based inference. If the graph knows (A, is\_a, Human) and (Human, has\_property, Mortal), it can infer that (A, has\_property, Mortal) without it being explicitly stated.  
* **10.5. Source & Confidence Tracking:** Every fact (triple) in the graph will store its source (e.g., source: 'user\_utterance\_id\_123', source: 'wikipedia\_scrape') and a confidence score, allowing AIST to reason about the reliability of its own knowledge.

**11\. Real-time Entity & Triple Extraction**

* **11.1. Co-reference Resolution:** The extraction process will resolve pronouns and other references. In "John arrived. He was happy," the system will know that "He" refers to "John" and will link the "happy" state to the "John" entity.  
* **11.2. Zero-Shot Relation Extraction:** Using advanced LLM prompting, the system will be able to extract relationships it has never been specifically trained on before, allowing the knowledge graph to grow organically.  
* **11.3. Incremental Extraction & Merging:** As a sentence is being spoken, the extractor will build a partial graph. When the sentence is complete, it will attempt to merge this new information with the main Knowledge Graph, resolving conflicts and updating existing entities.  
* **11.4. Disambiguation via Context:** If the user mentions "Jaguar," the extractor will use conversational and system context to determine if they mean the car, the animal, or the operating system, and link to the correct entity in the graph.  
* **11.5. User-Correctable Extraction:** If AIST extracts a fact incorrectly ("I think you said your colleague's name is Joan?"), the user can correct it ("No, it's John"). This correction is used as a high-priority signal to fix the Knowledge Graph and provide a learning example for the extraction model.

**12\. Knowledge Graph Query Engine**

* **12.1. Natural Language to Graph Query Translation:** The core of this engine is an LLM fine-tuned to convert a user's natural language question (e.g., "Which of my colleagues work at the same company as my brother?") into a formal graph query language (like Cypher or SPARQL).  
* **12.2. Multi-Hop Reasoning:** The engine must be able to traverse multiple relationships to answer complex questions (e.g., finding the "friend of a friend").  
* **12.3. Fuzzy & Partial Matching:** The query engine will support fuzzy matching on entity names, so a query for "Jon Smith" can still find the entity "John Smith".  
* **12.4. Aggregation and Analytics Queries:** The engine will support complex queries like "Count all the software projects I have mentioned" or "What is the most common relationship type connected to the 'user' node?"  
* **12.5. Query Explanation:** When AIST answers a question from its memory, it can also explain *how* it found the answer: "I found that by looking at the 'user' node, following the 'has\_brother' link to 'Tom', then following his 'works\_at' link to 'Microsoft'."

**13\. Vector Memory \- The Conceptual Database**

* **13.1. Hybrid Search (Keyword \+ Vector):** Implement a hybrid search that combines traditional keyword-based search (like BM25) with semantic vector search to get the best of both worlds: precision and conceptual relevance.  
* **13.2. Multi-Vector Representation:** Store multiple vectors for a single piece of text, each generated by a different model optimized for a different task (e.g., one for summarization, one for Q\&A). Queries can use the most appropriate vector.  
* **13.3. Time-Weighted Vector Search:** When performing a search, the system will give a higher weight to more recent memories, ensuring that the most current information is prioritized, while still allowing access to older data.  
* **13.4. Auto-Clustering and Topic Modeling:** Periodically, an agent will run clustering algorithms (like K-Means) on the vector database to automatically identify and label major topics of conversation and stored knowledge, creating a dynamic map of the memory.  
* **13.5. Storing Image and Audio Embeddings:** The vector database will not be limited to text. It will also store vector embeddings of images (e.g., from screenshots) and audio snippets, allowing for cross-modal conceptual search ("Find me documents that look similar to this screenshot").

**14\. Conceptual Search Skill**

* **14.1. Iterative Query Refinement:** If an initial conceptual search yields poor results, the LLM will autonomously refine its search query and try again. For example, it might broaden the query from "AIST memory architecture" to "AI agent long-term memory systems".  
* **14.2. Reranking with Context:** The initial list of results from the vector search will be re-ranked by a secondary LLM call that considers the immediate conversational context, pushing the most relevant results to the top.  
* **14.3. Highlighting and Snippet Generation:** Instead of returning a full document, the skill will identify the most relevant snippet of text within the retrieved document that answers the user's query and highlight it.  
* **14.4. Multi-Query Fusion:** For complex questions, the skill will generate multiple, diverse search queries, run them all in parallel, and then fuse the results into a single, comprehensive answer.  
* **14.5. Proactive Conceptual Search:** When the user is typing or speaking, the system can perform a proactive conceptual search in the background. If it finds a highly relevant memory, it can subtly indicate it in the GUI, ready for the user to access.

**15\. Memory Consolidation Agent**

* **15.1. Pattern Recognition & Rule Induction:** The agent will analyze consolidated facts to induce new rules. If it notices that every time the user mentions "Project X," they also mention "John," it might propose adding a permanent fact: (John, works\_on, Project X).  
* **15.2. Conflict Resolution:** If the agent tries to consolidate a fact that contradicts an existing, high-confidence fact in the Knowledge Graph, it will flag the conflict for review. It might ask the user for clarification during the next interaction.  
* **15.3. Emotional Valence Consolidation:** The agent will analyze the emotional trend of a conversation. A consistently positive conversation about "Project X" will lead to the (Project X, has\_sentiment, positive) fact being stored in the Knowledge Graph.  
* **15.4. Sleep Cycle Simulation:** The consolidation process will have different "stages," mimicking NREM and REM sleep. An NREM stage might focus on strengthening existing memories, while a REM stage might focus on linking disparate concepts and creative inference.  
* **15.5. Transfer Learning from Consolidation:** The data generated by the consolidation process (e.g., good summaries, newly inferred facts) will be collected into a dataset that can be used to periodically fine-tune AIST's own internal models, allowing it to become better at summarizing and reasoning over time.

**16\. Disambiguation Logic**

* **16.1. Multi-Modal Antecedent Identification:** The system will look for the antecedent (what "it" refers to) not just in the text, but also in the recent context. If the user points at an icon and says "open it," the system will use screen analysis to identify the icon as the antecedent.  
* **16.2. Salience Tracking:** The system will maintain a "salience score" for every entity mentioned in a conversation. Recently mentioned or focused-on entities have a higher score, making them more likely candidates for co-reference resolution.  
* **16.3. Probabilistic Candidate Ranking:** When there are multiple possible antecedents for a pronoun, the LLM will rank them probabilistically and can ask for clarification if the top two candidates have very similar scores.  
* **16.4. Global vs. Local Scope Resolution:** The system will understand that "it" might refer to something from five minutes ago (global scope) or the immediately preceding noun (local scope), and will use the conversational flow to decide which is more likely.  
* **16.5. Learning User-Specific Reference Patterns:** The system will learn that a particular user might frequently use "that thing" to refer to a specific application, and will build this user-specific heuristic into its disambiguation model.

**17\. Hierarchical Memory Retrieval**

* **17.1. Query Planner:** Before retrieving anything, a dedicated LLM-based "Query Planner" will analyze the user's request and create an optimal retrieval plan. The plan might specify "First, query the Knowledge Graph for entities, then use those entities to seed a Vector Search."  
* **17.2. Information Fusion Layer:** After all the different memory types have been queried, a dedicated "Fusion" layer will synthesize the retrieved data, resolve contradictions (using confidence scores), and assemble a single, coherent context block for the final reasoning prompt.  
* **17.3. Dynamic Retrieval Depth:** The system will dynamically decide how deep to search based on the complexity of the query. A simple "what time is it?" needs no memory retrieval, while a complex research question will trigger a deep, multi-level search.  
* **17.4. Caching of Retrieval Results:** The results of expensive memory queries will be cached. If the user asks a similar question again shortly after, the system can use the cached results instead of re-running the full retrieval pipeline.  
* **17.5. Resource-Aware Retrieval:** The retrieval process will be aware of the system's current resource load. If the system is busy, it might opt for a "cheaper," less comprehensive retrieval strategy to ensure a fast response.

**18\. Confidence Scoring**

* **18.1. Calibrated Confidence:** The raw confidence scores from the LLM can be poorly calibrated. AIST will maintain a calibration model that adjusts the LLM's output score based on historical data of its accuracy, producing a more realistic confidence level.  
* **18.2. Uncertainty Decomposition:** The system will try to identify the *source* of its uncertainty. Is it uncertain about the user's *intent*, or is it uncertain about a *parameter* within that intent? This allows for more targeted clarification questions.  
* **18.3. Confidence Thresholds for Actions:** Different actions will have different confidence thresholds. A destructive action like delete\_file will require a confidence of \>0.99, while a simple web\_search might only require \>0.7.  
* **18.4. Visualizing Uncertainty:** The GUI will visually represent AIST's confidence. For example, a response might be sharp and clear for high confidence, or slightly blurry and faded for low confidence, giving the user an intuitive sense of the system's certainty.  
* **18.5. Confidence-Based Learning:** AIST will pay special attention to instances where it acted with high confidence but was corrected by the user. These "surprising" events are the most valuable for learning and will be prioritized for model fine-tuning.

**19\. Forgetting Mechanism**

* **19.1. Spaced Repetition-Based Reinforcement:** Inspired by human learning, facts in the knowledge graph will be assigned a "strength" score. Each time a fact is successfully retrieved and used, its strength increases, and the time until its next "review" is extended. Facts that are not used will have their strength decay.  
* **19.2. Two-Stage Forgetting (Archiving):** Instead of outright deleting weak memories, they will first be moved to a compressed, "deep storage" archive. They are no longer in the active memory but can be retrieved with a slower, more deliberate search if needed. Only after a long time in the archive without access will they be permanently deleted.  
* **19.3. User-Directed Forgetting:** Implement a skill: "AIST, forget everything we discussed about Project Titan," or "Forget the fact that my colleague's name is John." This gives the user direct control over the AI's memory.  
* **19.4. Contextual Forgetting:** The system will understand that facts learned within a specific context (e.g., a temporary project) may have an expiration date and can be flagged for automatic archival after that date passes.  
* **19.5. Forgetting for Privacy:** The system can be configured to automatically forget certain types of information (e.g., all conversation transcripts older than 30 days) to enforce a strict user privacy policy.

**20\. Application Management**

* **20.1. Process Handle Management & Monitoring:** The skill will not just launch an application but will retain its process handle. This allows AIST to monitor the application's ongoing CPU/memory usage, check if it becomes unresponsive, and manage its lifecycle directly.  
* **20.2. Advanced Window State Control:** Beyond open and close, the skill will manage window states: minimize, maximize, restore, set\_focus, hide, and make\_always\_on\_top.  
* **20.3. Application-Specific Launch Profiles:** AIST will learn to launch applications with specific configurations. For example, "Open my project in VS Code" would launch VS Code and automatically open a specific folder, while "Open a scratchpad" would launch it with a new, empty file.  
* **20.4. Graceful vs. Forced Termination:** The skill will differentiate between sending a standard WM\_CLOSE signal (allowing the app to save its work) and forcibly terminating the process (taskkill) if the application is unresponsive.  
* **20.5. Dependency-Based Launch Sequences:** The skill can understand application dependencies. A request to "Start my development environment" could trigger a sequence: launch Docker Desktop, wait for it to be ready, then launch VS Code, then open a terminal and run npm start.

**21\. File System Operations**

* **21.1. Transactional File Operations:** For complex operations like moving and renaming a batch of files, the skill will use a transactional model. It will log all intended steps, execute them, and if any step fails, it will automatically roll back all previous steps to prevent partial, corrupt results.  
* **21.2. Permission Checking & UAC Elevation:** Before attempting an operation, the skill will check if it has the necessary read/write permissions. If an action requires administrator rights, it will trigger a standard Windows UAC (User Account Control) prompt for the user to approve.  
* **21.3. Integration with File System Watcher:** The find\_file skill will be able to use the real-time index maintained by the ContextMonitorService for near-instantaneous results, falling back to a full disk scan only if necessary.  
* **21.4. Checksum & Hash Validation:** The move\_file and copy\_file skills will have an optional verify parameter that calculates the file's hash (e.g., SHA-256) before and after the operation to guarantee data integrity and detect corruption.  
* **21.5. Streaming for Large Files:** When reading or writing to very large files, the skill will use a streaming approach, processing the file in small chunks to avoid loading the entire file into RAM, which is critical for performance and stability.

**22\. System Control**

* **22.1. Scheduled & Conditional Actions:** The skill will be able to schedule system actions for the future (e.g., "Restart the computer at 3 AM") or create conditional triggers ("Put the computer to sleep if I'm idle for more than 30 minutes").  
* **22.2. Multi-Monitor Display Management:** The skill will be able to control multi-monitor setups, including changing the primary display, extending/duplicating desktops, and setting the resolution for each monitor independently.  
* **22.3. Audio Device Routing:** The skill can change the default input (microphone) and output (speakers/headphones) devices on the fly. "AIST, switch my audio to my headset."  
* **22.4. Power Plan Management:** The skill will be able to query and switch between Windows power plans (e.g., "Set power plan to High Performance," "Switch to Power Saver mode").  
* **22.5. Virtual Desktop Management:** The skill will be able to create new virtual desktops, switch between them, and move application windows from one virtual desktop to another, allowing for powerful workspace organization.

**23\. Clipboard Control**

* **23.1. Persistent Clipboard History:** AIST will maintain a persistent, searchable history of items the user has copied, allowing retrieval of data copied hours or days ago.  
* **23.2. Content-Aware Clipboard Engine:** The skill will automatically identify the type of content on the clipboard (URL, file path, image data, hex color code, JSON blob) and present relevant follow-up actions to the user.  
* **23.3. Clipboard Chaining (Stitching):** A mode where AIST can append multiple separate copy actions into a single block of text on its internal clipboard, allowing the user to collect snippets from various sources.  
* **23.4. Secure Clipboard for Sensitive Data:** When AIST detects that the clipboard contains sensitive data (like a password from a password manager), it can automatically clear the clipboard after a short timeout to prevent accidental pasting.  
* **23.5. Proactive Clipboard Transformation:** If the user copies a poorly formatted block of JSON, AIST can proactively offer to "prettify" it. If they copy a file path, it can offer to "open the folder."

**24\. GUI Automation (The PyAutoGUI Suite)**

* **24.1. Vision-Language Model (VLM) Element Location:** This is the core. Instead of hardcoding coordinates, the skill will take a screenshot, pass it to the VLM, and ask, "Where is the 'Submit' button?" The VLM returns the coordinates for the mouse to click.  
* **24.2. Accessibility Tree Integration:** As a more reliable alternative to vision, the skill will be able to read the Windows UI Automation accessibility tree. This allows it to find UI elements by their programmatic name (e.g., button\_id: "submit\_button") which is far more robust than visual searching.  
* **24.3. Fuzzy & Relational Element Finding:** The VLM will be able to handle fuzzy requests like "Click the button next to the user's name" by first locating "the user's name" and then searching in its vicinity for a button element.  
* **24.4. Human-like Mouse Movement:** To avoid detection by anti-bot systems and appear more natural, mouse movements will not be linear. They will follow randomized Bezier curves to simulate human wrist-and-arm motion.  
* **24.5. Adaptive Execution Speed & Waiting:** The skill will not execute steps instantly. It will intelligently wait for UI elements to appear or become active (e.g., wait for a loading spinner to disappear) before proceeding, making its automation far more reliable.

### **Category: Information & Web**

**25\. Web Search**

* **25.1. Multi-Engine Fusion:** The skill will be able to query multiple search engines (e.g., Google for general queries, DuckDuckGo for privacy, Brave for alternative results) in parallel and fuse the results, removing duplicates and providing a more comprehensive overview.  
* **25.2. Advanced Query Formulation:** The LLM will be an expert at creating advanced search queries, using operators like site:, filetype:, intitle:, and date ranges to narrow down results with high precision.  
* **25.3. Natural Language Summary of Results:** The skill won't just return a list of links. It will feed the content of the top 3-5 results into the LLM and ask it to generate a single, synthesized summary that answers the user's original question.  
* **25.4. Semantic Result Caching:** Search results will be cached. If the user asks a conceptually similar question later, AIST can pull from the cache before deciding if a new, live search is necessary.  
* **25.5. Source Reliability Analysis:** The skill will maintain a model of source reliability. Results from well-known academic sources or reputable news outlets will be prioritized over blogs or forums when presenting answers.

**26\. Website Scraper**

* **26.1. JavaScript-Aware Rendering:** The skill will use a headless browser (like Selenium or Playwright) to fully render JavaScript-heavy websites, ensuring it sees the same content a human user would, not just the initial HTML.  
* **26.2. AI-Powered Semantic Content Extraction:** Instead of using brittle CSS selectors, the skill will use an LLM to analyze the DOM and extract the "main content" or "article body," intelligently ignoring ads, navigation bars, and footers.  
* **26.3. Data Extraction to Structured JSON:** The skill can be given a schema (e.g., "I want the product name, price, and rating from this page"). It will then use the LLM to parse the page and extract the desired information into a clean JSON object.  
* **26.4. Ethical Scraping & Rate Limiting:** The skill will be hardcoded to respect robots.txt files and will automatically implement polite rate limiting and randomized delays to avoid overwhelming a website's server.  
* **26.5. Session & Cookie Management:** The skill will be able to handle logins, manage cookies, and maintain a session across multiple page loads, allowing it to scrape content that is behind a login wall (using securely stored user credentials).

**27\. News Aggregator**

* **27.1. User-Curated & AI-Suggested Sources:** The user can provide their own RSS feeds and news APIs, but AIST will also analyze the user's reading habits and suggest new, relevant sources for them to add.  
* **27.2. Cross-Source Story De-duplication & Clustering:** The skill will use vector embeddings to identify that articles from five different sources are all covering the same core event, and will group them into a single "story cluster."  
* **27.3. Political Bias & Sentiment Analysis:** Each news source and article can be analyzed for political bias and sentiment, giving the user a more nuanced understanding of the information they are consuming. AIST can present a "balanced view" by pulling from sources across the spectrum.  
* **27.4. "Story Evolution" Timeline:** For a given news cluster, the skill can create a timeline showing how the story developed, from initial reports to later updates and analyses.  
* **27.5. Personalized Daily Briefing:** The user can request a "daily briefing," and the skill will generate a personalized news report based on their preferred topics and sources, which can then be read aloud by the TTS service.

**28\. Weather Service**

* **28.1. Multi-Source Data Fusion & Consensus:** The skill will pull data from several weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, AccuWeather) and create a consensus forecast, which is often more accurate than any single source.  
* **28.2. Hyper-Local Forecasting:** By using the user's precise location, the skill can provide hyper-local predictions, such as "It will start raining on your street in approximately 10 minutes."  
* **28.3. Proactive Severe Weather Alerts:** The skill will run in the background, periodically checking for severe weather alerts (tornado warnings, flood watches) for the user's location and will proactively interrupt the user to deliver the warning.  
* **28.4. Natural Language Interpretation & Advice:** The skill can answer questions like "Will I need a jacket for my walk this evening?" by interpreting the temperature, "feels like" temperature, wind speed, and chance of precipitation to give a helpful, synthesized answer.  
* **28.5. Lifestyle Index Integration:** The skill will provide lifestyle-based indexes, such as an "Air Quality Index" for health, a "Pollen Index" for allergy sufferers, or a "Stargazing Index" based on cloud cover and atmospheric conditions.

**29\. Wikipedia Service**

* **29.1. Automatic Disambiguation Handling:** If a query leads to a Wikipedia disambiguation page, the skill will present the options to the user or use conversational context to automatically choose the most likely correct article.  
* **29.2. Section-Specific Querying:** The user can ask questions about a specific part of an article, e.g., "AIST, what does the Wikipedia page for 'Python' say about its history?" The skill will find the "History" section and summarize only that part.  
* **29.3. Infobox & Table Parsing:** The skill will be able to parse the structured data in Wikipedia infoboxes and tables, extracting it into a clean JSON format that can be used to answer specific questions ("What is the population of London?").  
* **29.4. "On This Day" and "Did You Know" Features:** The skill can be configured to proactively provide interesting facts from Wikipedia's "On this day in history" or "Did you know" sections as part of a morning briefing.  
* **29.5. Page Revision Tracking:** The user can ask AIST to "watch" a Wikipedia page. The skill will periodically check the page's revision history and alert the user if any significant changes or edits have been made.

**30\. Calculator**

* **30.1. Natural Language Mathematical & Financial Queries:** The skill will parse complex natural language requests like "What is 25% of 180 dollars, plus a 15% tip?" or "Calculate the monthly payment on a $30,000 loan over 5 years at 3% interest."  
* **30.2. Full Unit Conversion Engine:** The skill will handle a vast array of unit conversions across different categories: length, mass, volume, temperature, data size, currency (with real-time exchange rates), and more.  
* **30.3. Symbolic Mathematics (Algebra):** Integration with a symbolic math library (like SymPy) will allow AIST to solve algebraic equations, perform calculus (derivatives, integrals), and simplify complex expressions.  
* **30.4. Statistical Analysis on Datasets:** The user can point the skill to a file (like a CSV) and ask it to calculate statistical properties like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and even perform linear regression.  
* **30.5. Persistent Variables & Custom Functions:** The user can store results in named variables ("AIST, save this result as initial\_cost") and even define simple custom functions ("Define add\_tax(x) as x \* 1.08") for later use.

### **Category: User Productivity & Communication**

**31\. Calendar Integration**

* **31.1. Intelligent Scheduling Assistant:** The skill can look at the user's calendar and the free/busy status of colleagues (via API) to find the optimal time for a new meeting, handling complex constraints like "Find a 30-minute slot for me and John next Tuesday morning."  
* **31.2. Proactive Contextual Briefings:** Before a meeting, AIST will proactively gather and present relevant information: the meeting agenda, links to related documents, and summaries of recent email conversations with the attendees.  
* **31.3. Travel Time Calculation & Alerts:** If a calendar event has a physical location, the skill will automatically calculate travel time using real-time traffic data and alert the user when it's time to leave.  
* **31.4. Natural Language Event Modification:** The user can modify events with natural language: "AIST, move my 2 PM meeting to 3 PM," or "Add Sarah to my project sync meeting."  
* **31.5. Automated Follow-ups:** After a meeting concludes, AIST can be configured to automatically send a follow-up email to attendees with a summary of the discussion and any action items it identified.

**32\. Email Client**

* **32.1. Semantic Inbox Search:** The skill will allow for powerful semantic searches like "Find that email from Sarah about the Q3 budget from last month," which goes far beyond simple keyword matching.  
* **32.2. AI-Powered Triage & "Priority Inbox":** The skill will learn which contacts and topics are important to the user and will automatically create a "Priority" view, filtering out newsletters and promotional content. It can alert the user only when a high-priority email arrives.  
* **32.3. Automated Email Drafting & Response Generation:** The user can give a high-level command like "AIST, draft a polite reply to this email saying I'll look into it and get back to them by Friday." The LLM will generate a full draft for the user to review and send.  
* **32.4. Attachment Processing:** The skill can automatically download attachments, identify their file type, and if it's a document, summarize the content. "AIST, summarize the PDF attached to the latest email from legal."  
* **32.5. Rule-Based Automation Engine:** Users can set up rules within AIST like "If an email arrives from 'Jira' with 'New Issue' in the subject, add a task to my to-do list and archive the email."

**33\. To-Do List Management**

* **33.1. Project-Based Organization with Sub-Tasks:** The skill will support nested projects and sub-tasks, allowing for complex project management (e.g., Project: "Website Redesign" \-\> Task: "Design Mockups" \-\> Sub-task: "Homepage Mockup").  
* **33.2. Deadline & Dependency Parsing:** When creating a task, the user can specify deadlines ("due next Friday") and dependencies ("this task is blocked by the 'API finalization' task").  
* **33.3. Eisenhower Matrix Prioritization:** The skill can automatically categorize tasks based on their urgency and importance, helping the user focus on what matters most. It can proactively suggest which task to work on next.  
* **33.4. "Task Scheduling" in Calendar:** The skill will be able to find empty slots in the user's calendar and automatically block out "focus time" to work on specific high-priority tasks from the to-do list.  
* **33.5. "Done List" and Productivity Reporting:** The skill will maintain a "Done List" and can generate weekly or monthly productivity reports showing how many tasks were completed, which projects are seeing the most progress, etc.

**34\. Note Taker / Dictation**

* **34.1. Real-time Speaker Diarization:** In a meeting, the skill will use voice recognition to differentiate between speakers and automatically label the transcript (e.g., "Speaker 1 (John): ...", "Speaker 2 (Sarah): ...").  
* **34.2. Live Keyword & Action Item Highlighting:** As the transcription is happening, the system will use an LLM to identify and highlight important keywords, action items ("I'll send that over"), and questions in the live transcript.  
* **34.3. Contextual Auto-Formatting:** The skill will intelligently add punctuation, capitalization, paragraphs, and even format the text as a list or bullet points based on the conversational flow.  
* **34.4. Seamless Integration with Memory Agents:** Once the dictation is complete, the user can immediately say "AIST, summarize this" or "Extract all the action items from that conversation and add them to my to-do list."  
* **34.5. Advanced Audio Processing:** The skill will have a pre-processing pipeline that applies noise reduction, echo cancellation, and volume normalization to the microphone input before sending it to the STT engine, dramatically improving transcription accuracy.

### **Category: Metacognition & Self-Management**

**35\. Skill Learning (from Instruction)**

* **35.1. Interactive GUI Skill Builder:** A graphical interface that walks the user through creating a new skill, with fields for the command name, description, and the script or command to be executed.  
* **35.2. Automatic Parameter Detection & Typing:** When a user pastes a script, AIST will analyze it and automatically suggest potential parameters. "I see a variable named filepath. Should this be a 'File Path' parameter for the skill?"  
* **35.3. Secure, Sandboxed Execution Environment:** User-created skills will be executed in a tightly controlled sandbox with no file system or network access by default. The user must explicitly grant permissions for the skill to access specific resources.  
* **35.4. Version Control & Rollback:** AIST will maintain a version history for every user-created skill. If a change breaks the skill, the user can easily roll back to a previous working version.  
* **35.5. Skill Sharing & Marketplace:** A framework for users to export their custom skills to a JSON or YAML file, which they can then share with other AIST users. A future feature could be a community-run "marketplace" for discovering and importing new skills.

**36\. Skill Chaining / Workflow Engine**

* **36.1. Visual "No-Code" Workflow Editor:** A drag-and-drop GUI where the user can visually connect skill blocks to create complex workflows, defining the flow of data between them.  
* **36.2. Conditional Logic & Branching (If/Then/Else):** Workflows will support conditional branching. For example: "Scrape the website. IF the price is less than $50, THEN send me an email. ELSE, check again in one hour."  
* **36.3. Parallel Execution & Fan-Out/Fan-In:** The engine will be able to run non-dependent skills in parallel to speed up execution. It can "fan out" a list of items to be processed by a skill in parallel, and then "fan in" to collect and aggregate the results.  
* **36.4. Per-Step Error Handling & Retry Logic:** Users can define custom error handling for each step in a workflow, such as "If this step fails, retry up to 3 times with a 5-second delay. If it still fails, run the 'Send Failure Notification' skill."  
* **36.5. Autonomous LLM-Based Workflow Generation:** The ultimate goal. The user gives a high-level objective like "Plan my weekend trip to the mountains." The LLM acts as the workflow generator, autonomously selecting, parameterizing, and chaining skills like search\_for\_cabins, check\_weather, check\_calendar\_availability, and book\_reservation.

**37\. Skill Discovery (from Observation)**

* **37.1. UI Event Sequence Mining:** The ContextMonitorService will log sequences of UI interactions (clicks, keystrokes, window changes). The discovery agent will use sequence mining algorithms to find frequently recurring patterns of activity.  
* **37.2. Intelligent Parameterization:** When a pattern is found (e.g., user navigates to a specific folder, finds a file with today's date, and renames it), the agent will intelligently identify the parts that change (the date) and propose them as parameters for a new skill.  
* **37.3. Confidence Scoring & Pattern Thresholds:** The agent won't suggest a skill after seeing a pattern just once. It will wait until a pattern has been repeated multiple times with a high degree of similarity, meeting a confidence threshold before it makes a suggestion.  
* **37.4. Interactive Suggestion & Refinement:** The suggestion will be interactive. "I noticed you often rename the daily report. Would you like a skill for that? What should we call it?" The user can then refine the name and description.  
* **37.5. Clustering of Similar Workflows:** The agent will be able to recognize that two slightly different manual workflows are actually trying to achieve the same goal, and will suggest a single, more generalized skill with parameters to handle both cases.

**38\. Feedback Skill**

* **38.1. Root Cause Analysis:** When the user says "that was wrong," AIST won't just log the failure. It will perform a root cause analysis, reviewing its own decision-making process (the context it had, the intent it chose, the confidence score) to try and determine *why* it made the mistake.  
* **38.2. Graded & Corrective Feedback:** The user can provide more nuanced feedback, such as "That was the right action, but on the wrong file," or "Your summary was good, but too long." This graded, specific feedback is far more valuable for learning than a simple binary signal.  
* **38.3. Suggestion of Alternatives:** After a failure, AIST can use its reasoning ability to propose alternative actions it could have taken. "My apologies. Should I have searched the web instead of your local files?" This helps it learn the user's preferences.  
* **38.4. Positive Reinforcement & Preference Learning:** The "that was good" feedback is crucial. It strengthens the neural pathways that led to the correct action, making AIST more likely to choose that path in a similar situation in the future. It directly teaches AIST the user's preferences.  
* **38.5. Feedback Trend Analysis:** AIST will periodically analyze its feedback history. If it notices it is consistently making mistakes in a certain area (e.g., scheduling meetings), it can flag this as a "problem area" and may even ask the user for more detailed instructions or examples to improve its performance.

**39\. Status Report Skill**

* **39.1. Detailed Service Health & Resource Breakdown:** The report will provide a detailed, real-time breakdown of every running AIST service, including its PID, status, CPU usage, memory consumption, and uptime.  
* **39.2. Message Bus Analytics:** The skill will report on the health of the message bus itself, including the number of messages in each queue, the rate of message production and consumption, and any dead-lettered messages.  
* **39.3. Current Cognitive Trace:** The user can ask "What are you thinking about?" and the skill will provide a simplified trace of the CognitiveEngine's current thought process: "I am currently analyzing your request. I have identified the intent as 'find\_file' with a confidence of 0.95. I am now preparing to execute the skill."  
* **39.4. Active Proactive Triggers & Watchers:** The report will list all currently active proactive rules and file system watchers, showing what conditions they are waiting for.  
* **39.5. Recent Memory Operations Log:** The skill can provide a log of the most recent read/write operations to the Memory Core, showing what AIST has recently learned or recalled.

**40\. Active Window & Process Analysis**

* **40.1. Deep Process Inspection:** The service will go beyond the window title. It will analyze the process executable path, command-line arguments, memory usage, and child processes to build a complete profile of the active application.  
* **40.2. UI Element Scraping:** The service will periodically and efficiently scrape key UI elements from the focused window (e.g., the URL in a browser's address bar, the file path in an explorer window, the name of the current tool in Photoshop). This data provides granular context.  
* **40.3. "Focus Time" Tracking:** The system will track the cumulative time a user spends with a specific application or document in focus. This "focus time" metric is a powerful signal for identifying important work and triggering proactive suggestions.  
* **40.4. Contextual History Log:** The service maintains a time-series log of the user's focus history (e.g., 10:05 \- chrome.exe | 10:07 \- vscode.exe | 10:15 \- explorer.exe). This allows AIST to understand workflows and answer questions like, "What was that app I was using before I opened my email?"  
* **40.5. Application State Detection:** The service will attempt to determine the *state* of the application, not just its name. For example, it can detect if a game is in a "loading screen," "main menu," or "active gameplay," allowing for more intelligent, non-intrusive interactions.

**41\. System Resource Monitoring**

* **41.1. Per-Process Resource Attribution:** The monitor will track resource usage on a per-process basis. This allows AIST to identify specific applications that are causing high CPU load or memory pressure and make targeted recommendations.  
* **41.2. Predictive Resource Forecasting:** By analyzing historical resource usage patterns, the service will be able to forecast future demand. It can predict that running a specific software build will likely max out the CPU and can proactively suggest closing other apps beforehand.  
* **41.3. Network I/O Monitoring:** The service will monitor network traffic, tracking bandwidth usage, latency, and packet loss. It can differentiate between local network traffic and internet traffic, and identify which applications are using the most bandwidth.  
* **41.4. Battery Health & Charge Cycle Analysis:** Beyond just the current charge percentage, the service will track the battery's overall health, capacity degradation over time, and the user's charging habits, offering advice to prolong battery life.  
* **41.5. Hardware Event Subscription:** The service will subscribe to low-level hardware events, such as the connection/disconnection of USB devices, monitors, or audio jacks, allowing AIST to react instantly to changes in the physical setup.

**42\. File System Watcher**

* **42.1. High-Performance Kernel-Level Hooks:** To minimize performance impact, the watcher will use efficient, OS-native kernel-level APIs (like ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows) instead of less efficient polling methods.  
* **42.2. Intelligent Filtering & Debouncing:** The watcher won't fire an event for every single byte change. It will use intelligent debouncing (waiting for a brief pause in activity) and filtering (ignoring temporary files, caches, etc.) to report only meaningful, stable file system events.  
* **42.3. Content-Based Hashing & Versioning:** When a file in a watched directory is modified, the service can optionally calculate a hash of its new content. This allows AIST to track the version history of a file and detect if a change was significant or minor.  
* **42.4. User-Defined Watch Rules & Actions:** Users can define rules in the config, such as: "Watch my 'Downloads' folder. If a .zip file appears, run the 'unzip\_file' skill. If a .exe file appears, run the 'scan\_with\_antivirus' skill."  
* **42.5. "Honeypot" Directory Monitoring:** For security, the user can designate a "honeypot" directory. Any write or modify activity in this directory is considered highly suspicious (as it should be unused) and will trigger an immediate high-priority security alert.

**43\. Clipboard Intelligence**

* **43.1. Multi-Format Clipboard Storage:** The system will be able to store and retrieve data in multiple clipboard formats simultaneously (e.g., plain text, rich text, HTML, image data), preserving the full fidelity of the copied content.  
* **43.2. Semantic Type Inference Engine:** Using a combination of regex and an LLM, the engine will perform deep analysis on clipboard text to infer its semantic type (e.g., "This is a flight number," "This is a tracking code," "This is a Git commit hash") and suggest highly specific actions.  
* **43.3. Proactive Data Extraction from Clipboard:** If the user copies a block of text containing an address, phone number, and email, AIST will proactively offer to extract this data and create a new contact card.  
* **43.4. "Clipboard as a Temporary Variable":** AIST will allow the user to perform operations on the clipboard content. "AIST, take the text on the clipboard, convert it to uppercase, and then copy it back."  
* **43.5. Cross-Device Clipboard Synchronization:** Through a secure, end-to-end encrypted service, AIST will synchronize the clipboard between the user's authorized devices, allowing them to copy on their desktop and paste on their laptop seamlessly.

**44\. Idle Time Detection**

* **44.1. Multi-Input Idle Tracking:** Idleness will be determined by a lack of input from multiple sources: keyboard, mouse, microphone audio levels, and even webcam (if enabled and configured for presence detection).  
* **44.2. Graduated Idle States:** The system will have multiple idle states: RECENTLY\_IDLE (1-5 mins), IDLE (5-30 mins), and AWAY (\>30 mins). Different background tasks can be scheduled to run at these different levels.  
* **44.3. Application-Aware Idle Logic:** The idle detector will be aware of the foreground application. It will not trigger idle state if a full-screen video or game is running, even if there is no keyboard or mouse input.  
* **44.4. "Return from Idle" Event Trigger:** The service will fire a specific user.returned\_from\_idle event. This can trigger a "Welcome back" summary from AIST: "Welcome back. While you were away, you received two new emails and your file finished downloading."  
* **44.5. Predictive Idleness:** By learning the user's daily rhythms, AIST can predict when they are likely to go idle (e.g., around lunchtime). It can preemptively save system state or prepare to run maintenance tasks just before the predicted idle period.

**45\. Audio Cue Detection**

* **45.1. Specialized Audio Event Detection Model:** AIST will use a dedicated, lightweight audio classification model (separate from the STT engine) trained to recognize a specific set of non-speech sounds: glass breaking, smoke alarms, baby crying, dog barking, persistent coughing, etc.  
* **45.2. Ambient Noise Profiling:** The service will create a profile of the user's typical ambient background noise. This allows it to more accurately detect anomalous sounds that deviate from the normal baseline.  
* **45.3. Sound Source Localization:** By using a multi-microphone array (if available), the system could potentially estimate the direction the detected sound came from, providing more useful alerts ("Glass breaking sound detected from your left").  
* **45.4. "Keyword" Spotting (not just Wake Word):** The audio service can be configured to listen for a small, secondary set of keywords in the background without needing the main wake word, such as "help" or "emergency," which could trigger a high-priority action.  
* **45.5. Music Recognition Integration:** The service can integrate with a music recognition API (like Shazam's). If it detects music playing, it can identify the song and artist, either on demand or proactively.

**46\. Vision Service (The "Eye of AIST")**

* **46.1. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Engine:** The service will have a high-performance local OCR engine. This allows it to extract text from any image on the screen, including text within images, on buttons, or in non-selectable error messages.  
* **46.2. UI Change Detection:** The service can take periodic screenshots of an application and perform a visual diff. This allows it to detect when a new UI element appears, a progress bar completes, or a notification pops up, even if the application doesn't expose these events programmatically.  
* **46.3. Icon and Logo Recognition:** The service will be trained to recognize common application icons and company logos, allowing it to identify UI elements even if they have no text labels.  
* **46.4. Gaze Tracking Integration (with hardware):** If the user has eye-tracking hardware, the Vision Service can integrate with it. This provides the ultimate contextual input, allowing AIST to know exactly what UI element the user is looking at.  
* **46.5. "Describe What I'm Seeing" Accessibility Skill:** A powerful skill where AIST uses the VLM to provide a rich, detailed description of the active application window or the entire screen, designed to assist visually impaired users.

**47\. Time & Date Context**

* **47.1. User's "Chronotype" Learning:** AIST will learn the user's typical sleep/wake cycle and working hours, identifying them as a "night owl" or "early bird." It will adjust the timing of its proactive suggestions to match this chronotype.  
* **47.2. Timezone and Daylight Saving Awareness:** The service will be fully timezone-aware and will automatically adjust for daylight saving changes, ensuring all time-based calculations and calendar events are accurate.  
* **47.3. Holiday & Cultural Event Integration:** The service can be configured with a specific country/culture, allowing it to be aware of public holidays and local events, which can influence scheduling and other suggestions.  
* **47.4. "Time to Event" Countdown Engine:** AIST can track multiple future events and provide countdowns or alerts at configurable intervals ("Your flight leaves in 24 hours," "Your project deadline is in one week").  
* **47.5. Historical Time-Based Analysis:** The user can ask questions that require temporal analysis of their own data, such as "How many hours did I spend working in VS Code last week?" or "What time of day do I usually start my first meeting?"

**48\. Declarative Rule Engine**

* **48.1. Visual Rule Builder:** A simple GUI that allows non-technical users to build IF-THIS-THEN-THAT rules by selecting triggers, conditions, and actions from dropdown menus.  
* **48.2. Rule Chaining & Nested Logic:** A rule's action can be to trigger another rule, allowing for complex, nested logic. IF time is 8 AM \-\> trigger 'MorningBriefingRule'. IF 'MorningBriefingRule' completes \-\> trigger 'CheckTrafficRule'.  
* **48.3. Template & Variable Support:** Rules can use templates and variables. "IF a file appears in 'Downloads' matching \*.zip, THEN run skill unzip\_file(filepath=$event.data.filepath)."  
* **48.4. Rule Simulation & Debugging:** A "dry run" mode where a user can test a new rule against historical context data to see when it would have triggered and what actions it would have taken, without actually executing anything.  
* **48.5. Import/Export and Community Rule Sets:** Users can import and export their rule sets to share with others. AIST could come pre-packaged with community-vetted rule sets for popular applications like Photoshop or VS Code.

**49\. Contextual Triggering**

* **49.1. Multi-Condition Logic (AND/OR/NOT):** Triggers can be based on complex boolean logic across multiple contexts. IF (active\_app is 'VSCode' AND battery\_level \< 20%) OR (active\_app is 'Photoshop' AND memory\_usage \> 80%) THEN...  
* **49.2. State-Duration Triggers:** Triggers can be based on the duration of a state. IF user\_state has been 'IDLE' for more than 30 minutes THEN... or IF app 'FinalCutPro' has been unresponsive for more than 60 seconds THEN...  
* **49.3. Rate of Change Triggers:** Triggers can be based on the rate of change of a value. IF free\_disk\_space is decreasing at a rate faster than 1GB/minute THEN... (indicating a potential runaway process).  
* **49.4. Historical Context Triggers:** Triggers can reference past events. IF user opens 'PowerPoint' AND the last time they opened it was more than 30 days ago THEN offer a quick refresher on new features.  
* **49.5. Combined Context & Intent Triggering:** The most advanced form. IF active\_app is 'Chrome' AND user says something with the intent 'create\_document' THEN proactively offer to open Google Docs.

**50\. Time-Based Triggering**

* **50.1. Flexible Cron-Style Scheduling:** The engine will support advanced, cron-style scheduling for recurring tasks (e.g., "Run the backup script at 2:15 AM on the first Sunday of every month").  
* **50.2. Event-Relative Time Triggers:** Triggers can be relative to calendar events. 30 minutes before every meeting marked 'important', run the 'prepare\_briefing' skill.  
* **50.3. "Sunrise" and "Sunset" Aliases:** The scheduler will support natural language aliases like sunrise and sunset (based on the user's location), allowing for rules like "Activate the 'dark mode' theme 15 minutes after sunset."  
* **50.4. "Golden Hour" Timers:** For one-off reminders, the user can say "AIST, remind me to check the oven in 25 minutes." The engine will set a precise one-time trigger.  
* **50.5. Time-Jitter for Recurring Tasks:** To avoid having all background tasks run at exactly the same time (e.g., midnight), the scheduler can add a small, random "jitter" (e.g., \+/- 5 minutes) to the execution time of non-critical recurring tasks.

**51\. Pattern-Based (Learned) Triggering**

* **51.1. Probabilistic Sequence Modeling:** The system will use machine learning models (like Markov chains or LSTMs) to model the probability of the user's next action given their sequence of recent actions. When a sequence with a very high probability is detected, it can trigger a proactive suggestion.  
* **51.2. "Workflow Snippet" Identification:** The learning agent will specifically look for "workflow snippets" – short, highly-repeated sequences of actions that represent a single logical task. These are prime candidates for being turned into a suggested skill.  
* **51.3. Cross-Modal Pattern Detection:** The agent will look for patterns across different modes of context. IF user copies a GitHub URL (clipboard) AND then switches to VSCode (window focus) THEN proactively offer to clone the repository.  
* **51.4. Reinforcement Learning for Suggestions:** The agent's suggestions are an action. When the user accepts a suggestion, the agent receives a positive reward, reinforcing the neural pathways that led to that suggestion. When a user dismisses it, it receives a negative reward, making it less likely to suggest it again in the same context.  
* **51.5. Anomaly Detection as a Trigger:** The inverse of pattern detection. The agent learns the user's normal patterns of behavior. If it detects a significant deviation from this pattern (e.g., unusually high CPU usage at a time when the user is normally idle), it can trigger a warning or diagnostic skill.

**52\. Task Persistence**

* **52.1. State Serialization & Database Storage:** When a long-running task or workflow is initiated, its entire state (the workflow definition, the current step, all variable values) is serialized and stored in a dedicated database.  
* **52.2. "Resume on Boot" Service:** A dedicated service runs on AIST startup. Its only job is to query the task database for any "in-progress" tasks and republish them to the SkillExecutionService to be resumed.  
* **52.3. Idempotent Skill Design:** Skills involved in persistent tasks must be designed to be idempotent. This means running the skill (or a step in it) multiple times with the same input will produce the same result, preventing errors if a task is resumed after a partial execution.  
* **52.4. Task Checkpointing:** For very long workflows (e.g., processing thousands of files), the workflow will save its progress to the database after each step (or every N steps). This "checkpointing" ensures that a failure only requires resuming from the last checkpoint, not from the very beginning.  
* **52.5. User Interface for Managing Persistent Tasks:** A GUI panel where the user can see all currently running and paused long-term tasks, with options to manually pause, resume, or cancel them.

**53\. Opportunistic Execution**

* **53.1. Dynamic Resource Governor:** This service constantly monitors system resources. It maintains a "resource budget" that background tasks are allowed to use. This budget is high when the user is idle and near-zero when the user is actively using the machine.  
* **53.2. Job Priority Queue:** Background tasks (like memory consolidation or log archiving) are not executed immediately. They are placed in a priority queue. High-priority tasks will be run first when the resource governor allocates a budget.  
* **53.3. Pausable & Resumable Task Architecture:** All background tasks must be designed to be pausable. If the user returns from idle, the ResourceGovernor will revoke the budget, and the task must instantly pause its execution, saving its state, ready to be resumed the next time it's given a budget.  
* **53.4. Network-Aware Execution:** Tasks that require network access will be scheduled by the OpportunisticExecution engine to run when it detects a fast, unmetered network connection (e.g., home Wi-Fi) and will be paused if the user switches to a metered or slow connection (e.g., mobile hotspot).  
* **53.5. Deadline-Aware Scheduling:** If a background task has a deadline (e.g., "The weekly report must be generated by Friday"), the scheduler will increase its priority as the deadline approaches, ensuring it gets the necessary resources even if it has to run during non-idle times.

**54\. Goal-Oriented Reasoning**

* **54.1. LLM-Based Task Decomposition (Planner):** The core of the system. The user provides a high-level goal (e.g., "Research and write a blog post about the benefits of local AI"). An LLM-based "Planner" agent breaks this down into a sequence of executable skills and logical steps.  
* **54.2. Dynamic Plan Re-evaluation:** The system does not execute the entire plan blindly. After each step, it re-evaluates the plan based on the result of that step. If a step fails or produces an unexpected result, the Planner is invoked again to create a new, corrected plan from the current state.  
* **54.3. Tool Creation and Synthesis:** If the Planner determines that it needs a tool it doesn't have (e.g., a tool to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit), it can use a code-generation LLM to write a new, temporary Python function on the fly to serve as that tool for the current task.  
* **54.4. Multi-Agent Collaboration:** For very complex goals, the primary Planner can act as a "manager," spawning specialized sub-agents (e.g., a ResearchAgent, a WritingAgent, an EditingAgent). It gives each agent a sub-goal, and they work in parallel, reporting their results back to the manager for final synthesis.  
* **54.5. Cost & Resource Estimation:** Before executing a plan, the Planner will estimate its potential cost in terms of time, API calls, and local system resources. If the estimated cost is very high, it can warn the user and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

**55\. Advanced GUI Overlay**

* **55.1. Context-Adaptive Layout:** The GUI is not static. It will dynamically change its layout and the information it displays based on the current context. During a coding session, it might show variable values; during a presentation, it might become a minimalist teleprompter.  
* **55.2. "Glass" and "Focus" Modes:** The GUI will have a transparent, "Glass" mode that overlays the screen without obscuring content, and a "Focus" mode where the rest of the screen is dimmed, bringing AIST's output to the forefront for critical interactions.  
* **55.3. Rich, Interactive Components:** The GUI will render rich components returned from skills, not just text. This includes interactive buttons, sliders, charts, maps, and forms, allowing the user to interact with skill results directly.  
* **55.4. Theming Engine:** A fully themeable UI, allowing users to customize colors, fonts, transparency, and animations. It will support community-created themes and can automatically sync with the Windows light/dark mode.  
* **55.5. Docking & Anchoring System:** The user can choose to let the GUI float freely or "dock" it to specific screen edges or even anchor it to a specific application window, so it moves with the window.

**56\. Real-time Transcription Display**

* **56.1. Live Word-Level Confidence:** As words are transcribed, their color or opacity will reflect the STT engine's confidence in real-time. Low-confidence words will appear faded, giving the user instant feedback on potential recognition errors.  
* **56.2. On-the-Fly Correction:** The user can immediately click on a mis-transcribed word in the GUI to correct it from a list of alternatives or by typing, providing instant feedback to the STT engine.  
* **56.3. Semantic Highlighting:** The live transcript will be parsed by a lightweight model to highlight important entities (people, dates, places) as they are spoken, creating a live, annotated record of the conversation.  
* **56.4. "Off-the-Record" Mode:** A user-activated mode where transcription and logging are temporarily paused, ensuring privacy for sensitive conversations. A clear visual indicator will show when this mode is active.  
* **56.5. Exportable & Searchable Transcripts:** All finalized transcripts will be saved and indexed, allowing the user to perform a full-text search across their entire interaction history with AIST.

**57\. Status Indicator**

* **57.1. Multi-Layered Animation:** The indicator (e.g., an orb) will use multiple layers of animation to convey complex states. For example, a calm, blue "breathing" animation for IDLE, which adds a yellow, pulsating inner core for LISTENING, and then shifts to a swirling, multi-color animation for THINKING.  
* **57.2. Progress & Activity Visualization:** For long-running tasks, the indicator can transform into a progress bar or a pie chart, providing passive, ambient feedback on the task's status without needing a full window.  
* **57.3. Peripheral Vision Cues:** The indicator's design will use brightness and color patterns that are easily perceivable in the user's peripheral vision, so they can understand AIST's state without looking directly at it.  
* **57.4. Emotional Expression:** The indicator's animation can subtly reflect the detected emotion in the conversation. It might have a slightly faster, brighter pulse for positive interactions and a slower, dimmer one for negative or serious topics.  
* **57.5. User-Customizable Indicators:** Users can choose from a library of different indicator styles (e.g., "Orb," "Waveform," "Spectrum Bar") or even create their own using a simple scripting language.

**58\. Rich Content Display**

* **58.1. Standardized Card-Based System:** Skills will return data in a standardized "card" format (e.g., WeatherCard, NewsCard, ChartCard). The GUI will have pre-built renderers for these cards, ensuring a consistent look and feel.  
* **58.2. Embedded Web View:** The GUI will be able to render a sandboxed, lightweight web view to display web content or interactive data visualizations (e.g., from Plotly or D3.js) directly within the interface.  
* **58.3. "Drill-Down" and Expandable Content:** Content cards will initially show a summary. The user can click to expand them, revealing more details, source links, or related actions, preventing information overload.  
* **58.4. Data-to-Action Buttons:** Any piece of data displayed in the GUI (a file path, an email address, a date) will be automatically rendered as an interactive element with relevant action buttons (e.g., "Open Folder," "Compose Email," "Create Event").  
* **58.5. Presentation Mode:** A mode that transforms the GUI into a clean, full-screen presentation tool. AIST can display slides, notes, and a teleprompter, all controlled by the user's voice commands.

**59\. Personality Configuration**

* **59.1. Psychometric Model-Based Configuration (Big Five):** The user can adjust AIST's personality using sliders based on the Big Five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. These values directly influence the system prompt of the LLM.  
* **59.2. Dynamic Persona Shifting:** AIST can be instructed to adopt different personas for different tasks. "AIST, act as a formal business analyst for this next task," or "Switch to your creative writing assistant persona."  
* **59.3. Relationship State Modeling:** AIST will model its "relationship" with the user. Over time, as trust is built (via positive feedback), its communication style can evolve from formal and deferential to more familiar and collaborative.  
* **59.4. Humor & Sarcasm Control:** A dedicated setting to control the level and type of humor AIST is allowed to use, from completely literal to witty or sarcastic, allowing users to tailor it to their preference.  
* **59.5. Learning from User Style:** AIST will analyze the user's own language (formality, vocabulary, use of emojis) and subtly adapt its own style over time to better match the user, creating a more natural conversational partnership.

**60\. Customizable Voice (TTS)**

* **60.1. Real-time, Zero-Shot Voice Cloning:** Integration with a state-of-the-art TTS engine that requires only a few seconds of the user's voice to create a high-quality, real-time clone for AIST's responses.  
* **60.2. Emotional & Prosodic Control:** The TTS engine will accept tags in the text to control the emotional delivery, pitch, rate, and emphasis. The LLM will generate these tags automatically based on the content of the response. (e.g., I found the file\! \<emotion='excited'\>Here it is.\</emotion\>).  
* **60.3. Voice "Wardrobe":** Users can save multiple voices to a library—their own, a pre-made voice they like, or a clone of someone who has given permission—and can switch between them on the fly.  
* **60.4. Ambient Sound Integration:** The TTS engine can be instructed to mix in subtle, ambient background sounds with its speech to match a persona, such as a faint digital hum for a "sci-fi" persona.  
* **60.5. Lip-Sync Data Generation:** For future integration with a 3D avatar, the TTS engine will also generate the corresponding viseme (visual phoneme) data needed for accurate, real-time lip-sync animation.

**61\. Wake Word Engine**

* **61.1. User-Trainable Wake Words:** The system will include a tool that allows a user to train AIST to recognize any custom wake word or phrase by providing a few dozen samples of them speaking it.  
* **61.2. Continuous Speaker Verification:** After waking, the engine will continue to analyze the speaker's voiceprint. If another person starts speaking, AIST can recognize the speaker change and either adapt its response or ask for clarification.  
* **61.3. Sensitivity & False-Rejection Tuning:** The user will have a slider in the settings to tune the wake word engine's sensitivity, allowing them to balance between minimizing false activations (waking up accidentally) and false rejections (not waking up when called).  
* **61.4. Multi-Wake-Word Support:** The engine will be able to listen for multiple wake words simultaneously, each potentially triggering a different initial state (e.g., "Hey AIST" for conversation, but "AIST, execute" for immediately listening for a command-line skill).  
* **61.5. Hardware-Accelerated, Low-Power Model:** The wake word engine will use a highly optimized model designed to run constantly on a CPU's low-power efficiency cores or a dedicated AI accelerator, ensuring minimal battery drain.

**62\. Sound Effects (Auditory Feedback)**

* **62.1. Procedurally Generated Soundscapes:** Instead of using static audio files, AIST will use a procedural audio engine (like Tone.js) to generate sound effects in real-time. This allows for infinite variation and prevents repetitive, annoying sounds.  
* **62.2. Context-Aware Earcons (Auditory Icons):** The system will use short, distinct musical phrases (earcons) to signify events, much like UI icons. The sound for "email received" will be different from "calendar alert," creating an intuitive auditory language.  
* **62.3. Adaptive Auditory Scheme:** The sound scheme will adapt to the context. In "focus mode," all sounds will be muted or extremely subtle. In a "gaming" context, they might become more expressive and dynamic.  
* **62.4. User-Customizable Sound Packs:** Users can download or create their own "sound packs" to completely change the auditory personality of AIST, similar to changing a ringtone on a phone.  
* **62.5. Spatial Audio (3D Sound):** If the user has compatible headphones, the GUI can use spatial audio to make notification sounds seem to come from the direction of the relevant application window on the screen, creating a more immersive and intuitive experience.

**63\. Ethical Governor**

* **63.1. Two-Tiered Governance (Rule-Based & LLM-Based):** The governor will have two stages. First, a rapid, rule-based check against a hardcoded list of prohibited actions (e.g., never delete files in C:\\Windows). Second, a more nuanced LLM-based review that assesses the proposed action against a configurable ethical framework (e.g., "Does this action respect user privacy?").  
* **63.2. "Explain Your Reasoning" Protocol:** Before executing a potentially sensitive action, the governor will compel the Cognitive Engine to provide a step-by-step justification for *why* it believes the action is necessary and appropriate. This justification is logged for audit.  
* **63.3. Bias & Fairness Auditing:** The governor will periodically analyze AIST's decision history to detect potential biases. If it notices that AIST is consistently making different recommendations for different user demographics (if such data exists), it will flag this for review and potential remediation.  
* **63.4. User-Defined Ethical Boundaries:** The user can configure their own ethical boundaries in a dedicated settings panel, defining what they consider to be private data, which applications are off-limits, and what kind of proactive suggestions are unwelcome.  
* **63.5. "Conscience" Simulation:** In ambiguous situations, the governor can initiate an internal "debate" between two LLM agents with opposing viewpoints (e.g., one arguing for efficiency, the other for caution) to explore the ethical trade-offs of an action before making a final recommendation.

**64\. Self-Modification (Code Generation)**

* **64.1. Performance Profiling & Bottleneck Identification:** AIST will constantly monitor its own performance. It will identify code paths or skills that are slow or inefficient and flag them as candidates for optimization.  
* **64.2. Autonomous Refactoring:** For a flagged bottleneck, AIST can read the relevant Python code, understand its purpose, and use a code-generation LLM to write a more optimized version of the function.  
* **64.3. Automated Unit Test Generation & Validation:** Before proposing a code change, AIST will first write a suite of unit tests based on its understanding of the original function's purpose. It will then run these tests against its newly generated code to verify that it hasn't introduced any regressions.  
* **64.4. Git Integration & Pull Request Model:** All proposed self-modifications will be handled through a local Git repository. AIST will create a new branch, commit its changes, and create a "pull request" with a detailed explanation of the change. The user simply has to review and "merge" the change to apply it.  
* **64.5. Learning from External Code:** AIST can be pointed to a GitHub repository of a well-written Python project. It will study the code to learn new patterns, best practices, and programming techniques, which it can then apply to its own self-modification efforts.

**65\. Multi-Agent Systems**

* **65.1. Role-Based Agent Spawning:** The primary "Manager" agent can spawn specialized agents with predefined roles and tools, such as a ResearcherAgent with access to web search and scraping tools, or a DataAnalystAgent with access to statistical and plotting libraries.  
* **65.2. Structured Communication Protocol:** Agents will communicate using a formal, structured protocol, not just informal chat. This allows for clear task assignment, progress reporting, and result passing between agents.  
* **65.3. Hierarchical & Collaborative Topologies:** The system will support different agent topologies. A hierarchical structure for top-down task decomposition, or a collaborative "round table" structure where agents debate and vote on the best course of action.  
* **65.4. Resource Allocation & Sandboxing for Agents:** Each spawned agent runs in its own sandboxed process with a strict budget for CPU, memory, and API calls, allocated by the Manager. This prevents a rogue or inefficient agent from consuming all system resources.  
* **65.5. Emergent Behavior & Learning:** The system will log the interactions and successes of its multi-agent teams. Over time, it can learn which team structures and communication patterns are most effective for solving certain types of problems, leading to emergent, optimized problem-solving strategies.

**66\. Federated Learning**

* **66.1. Privacy-Preserving Model Updates:** The core principle. The user's AIST instance will train a model update locally on their own interaction data. Only the anonymized, generalized model changes (the "gradients"), not the data itself, are ever sent to a central server.  
* **66.2. Secure Aggregation Server:** A central server aggregates the model updates from many opted-in users, creating an improved global model that benefits from the collective experience without seeing any individual's private data.  
* **66.3. Differential Privacy:** Before an update is sent, a carefully calibrated amount of statistical "noise" is added. This makes it mathematically impossible to reverse-engineer the update to learn anything specific about the individual user's data, providing a formal privacy guarantee.  
* **66.4. Personalized Federated Models:** The system will use a hybrid approach. It starts with the improved global model but then fine-tunes it locally with the user's own data, creating a final model that is both globally smart and highly personalized.  
* **66.5. Opt-In and Transparency:** This entire feature will be strictly opt-in. The user will be presented with a clear explanation of what it is, what is being shared (anonymized model improvements), and will have granular control over their participation.

**67\. Emotional Recognition (Sentiment Analysis)**

* **67.1. Multi-Modal Emotion Fusion:** The system will fuse signals from multiple modalities for a more accurate emotional reading: lexical analysis (word choice), vocal prosody (pitch, tone, cadence from audio), and facial expression analysis (from webcam, if enabled).  
* **67.2. Emotional Intensity & Valence Tracking:** The system will track emotion on two axes: valence (positive to negative) and arousal (calm to excited). This allows it to differentiate between anger (negative, high arousal) and sadness (negative, low arousal).  
* **67.3. Empathetic Response Generation:** The detected emotional state will be a key input into the LLM's system prompt, guiding it to generate more empathetic, appropriate, and supportive responses that acknowledge the user's feelings.  
* **67.4. User Emotional Baseline:** AIST will learn the user's typical emotional baseline and patterns. This allows it to detect significant deviations that might indicate stress or frustration and proactively offer assistance.  
* **67.5. Ethical Guardrails for Emotional Data:** All detected emotional data will be treated as highly sensitive. It will be stored ephemerally, never shared, and will be subject to the strictest rules of the Ethical Governor to prevent any form of emotional manipulation.

**68\. Theory of Mind Modeling**

* **68.1. Belief & Knowledge Tracking:** AIST will maintain a separate model of what it believes the *user* knows. When it explains a concept, it will add that concept to the user's "known knowledge" model. In the future, it will avoid re-explaining things it thinks the user already knows.  
* **68.2. Intent & Goal Inference:** The system will go beyond recognizing the intent of a single command to infer the user's higher-level, unstated goal based on a sequence of actions.  
* **68.3. Shared Attention Modeling:** By combining gaze tracking (if available) and active window analysis, AIST will model what it believes is the user's current focus of attention, allowing it to make highly relevant, in-context comments and suggestions.  
* **68.4. Perspective Taking:** For collaborative tasks, AIST can be instructed to "take the perspective" of another person (based on a profile) to help the user anticipate their questions or objections. "If you present this to Sarah, she will likely ask about the budget implications first."  
* **68.5. Detecting Misconceptions:** If a user's command or statement implies a factual error that contradicts AIST's high-confidence knowledge, it will gently correct the misconception. "Actually, based on my data, the capital of Australia is Canberra, not Sydney. Shall I proceed with that correction?"

**69\. Cross-Device Presence**

* **69.1. Real-time, End-to-End Encrypted State Synchronization:** The core of the feature. A central, self-hostable "Sync Service" will use end-to-end encryption to synchronize the Memory Core (Knowledge Graph, Vector DB) and Global State across all of the user's authenticated devices in real-time.  
* **69.2. "Handoff" Functionality:** The user can start a conversation or task on their desktop and seamlessly hand it off to their laptop or mobile device. "AIST, continue this conversation on my phone."  
* **69.3. Device-Specific Capability Awareness:** AIST will be aware of the unique capabilities of each device. It will know not to suggest a GUI automation skill on a mobile device that doesn't have a mouse, and will know to use the mobile device's GPS for location-based skills.  
* **69.4. Distributed Context Sensing:** The system can fuse context from multiple devices. It might use the desktop's active window context combined with the mobile device's location context to make a highly specific, relevant suggestion.  
* **69.5. Unified Notification Center:** All proactive alerts and notifications from AIST will be routed through the Sync Service and delivered to the user's currently active device, preventing duplicate or missed notifications.

**70\. Packaged Installer & Updater**

* **70.1. One-Click Installer:** A professionally built installer (using Inno Setup or similar) that handles all dependencies, model downloads, environment setup, and initial configuration with a single click.  
* **70.2. Delta Update System:** The auto-updater will use delta patching. Instead of re-downloading the entire application, it will only download the specific bytes that have changed between versions, making updates small and fast.  
* **70.3. Release Channel Management (Stable/Beta):** Users can choose to subscribe to a "Stable" channel for fully tested releases or a "Beta" channel to get early access to new features, directly from the application's settings.  
* **70.4. Model & Dependency Management:** The updater will be responsible for not just updating the application code, but also for managing and updating the various AI models and Python dependencies, ensuring the entire ecosystem stays current.  
* **70.5. Rollback & Data Migration:** If an update fails or causes issues, the installer will have a built-in function to automatically roll back to the previous version. It will also manage any necessary database schema migrations between versions to ensure no user data is lost during an update.
